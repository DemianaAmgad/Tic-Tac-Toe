# Tic-Tac-Toe
This C++ program is a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can compete against a bot or another player. It features a 3x3 grid, with players taking turns to select positions. The bot moves randomly, and the game checks for a winner or a tie after each turn. The interface displays the grid and provides feedback on invalid moves.
